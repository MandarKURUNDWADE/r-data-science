# 📊 R Programming Modules

This repository contains comprehensive R programming tutorials and scripts on essential topics ranging from data manipulation and visualization to object-oriented programming and Shiny web applications.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each folder covers a core concept in R programming:

- **Data_Manipulation** – Learn how to clean, filter, arrange, mutate, and summarize data using packages like `dplyr`.
- **Data_Visualization_in_R** – Explore data visualization techniques using `ggplot2` and base R plotting functions.
- **Functions_in_R** – Understand how to write and use functions, including anonymous and higher-order functions.
- **OOPs_Concept_in_R** – Get introduced to object-oriented programming (S3, S4, R6) in R.
- **ShinyR** – Build interactive web applications using R's powerful Shiny framework.
- **String_Function_in_R** – Work with strings and text data using functions from base R and the `stringr` package.
